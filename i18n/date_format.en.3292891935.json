["You may pass a string literal instead of a variable into the DATETIME function,\nwhich executes the function at compile-time and inlines the resulting formatted date. The date needs to be in\nISO-8601 format for this to work.  ","Compile time execution","Fluent: Formatting dates","Luckily the browsers {H0a|Intl API|href|https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat} helps us out once again. \nOnce again, due to Elms restrictions, you need to npm install {H0a|intl-proxy|href|https://www.npmjs.com/package/intl-proxy} \nand pass it into your Elm application as a flag. The generated code will force you to pass this when creating the\ninitial {H1code|I18n|} instance, at which point you never need to use it explicitely in your program again.","Elm and the Intl APIs","The NumberFormat.format method can take a variety of different options which are documented\n{H0a|here|href|https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat}. To use them, just add them as comma-seperated arguments to the DATETIME function call.\nFor example, {H1code|DATETIME($date, dateStyle: \"full\")|} will pass the argument to the Intl API, which will then\nshow weekday and month in textual form (for example \"Sunday, 20 December 2020\").  ","Additional options","Dates can be presented in even more different ways than numbers can.\nOrder of year/month/day differs depending on the language, and if you want to actually display the full\nweekday/month... you are going to have a bad time."]
