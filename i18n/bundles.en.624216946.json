["Make sure you need this feature before using it. It weakens your compile-time guarantees,\nsince you need to remember to include the right bundles on the right pages. If a key is not loaded yet, the respective function\nwill return an empty string. Right now, Travelm-Agency compiles all of your translation keys into a flat list of exports,\nwhich does not really help in particular to distinguish the corresponding files where the keys are contained.\nIf you benchmarked and found out that bundling improves your render time a lot, let me know. I'm open for pull requests and suggestions\nto improve the generated code.","Considerations","The editor lets you create new files on this page! Add new bundles and see how the output changes.","Explore","Translation bundles","Until now, we only considered a single set of translation files for multiple languages.\nIn large applications, we might benefit from not loading all translations for a language at once, but instead\nloading just the translations we need for the current page or subtree of pages. This\nfeature is only doing something relevant in {H0code|Dynamic|} mode, since in {H0code|Inline|} mode,\nall translations are in the main Elm bundle regardless."]
